          Underground Universal is founded by an underground hip-hop producer
          who saw the need for a label that wouldn't take advantage of creators
          like him. Our belief is because it is your music, your art, your
          royalties should be yours too. Unlike other labels, we don't take
          what's yours. Through our online platform we strive to serve your
          creative needs by providing easy access to collaborators, engineers,
          studios, music distribution and promotion.
